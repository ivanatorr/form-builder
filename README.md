# \[Form Builder\]



Front End application oriented to  create a simple one-page site or form to fill out by dragging the desired element onto the work surface

## Technologies used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) single page application
- Using [build-ui](https://luismps.github.io/build-ui/) to get better experience when creating form builder app
- State management via [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- For easy styling UI components using [Bootsrap React](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- To get cool icons was used [Font Awesome](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/default.asp)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
2. Start the frontend application locally
```bash
npm start
```


## Available commands

* `npm start`: Start the app locally in your development environment, by default it will be in http://localhost:3000.
* `npm test`: Run tests using watch mode.
* `npm lint`: Run linter.



## Linter

In order to lint the code, the project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), which is provided by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you want to run the linter just type:
```bash
yarn lint
```

It's also convenient to integrate the linter warnings into your code editor, there are many plugins available for ESLint depending on your text editor used.


This app was bootstraped based on the template provided by [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
